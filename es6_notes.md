#ES6 Notes

Harmony, ES6, ES2015, are names of the same thing, a Javascript update.

##let and const
* Variables declared with **let** can be reassigned, but can’t be redeclared in the same scope.
* Variables declared with **const** must be assigned an initial value, but can’t be redeclared in the same scope, and can’t be reassigned.

_Using **var** is no longer recommended._
